# COALESCE Lab

Laboratory for the computational analysis of egonetworks, social cohesion and exclusion at [Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB)](https://www.uab.cat/).

The COALESCE Lab is a research group dedicated to studying processes of social cohesion, polarization, and exclusion from a social network perspective. While these processes are fundamentally relational, they are often studied on an individual level, or on the basis of social media networks. The COALESCE Lab aims to contribute to international research on these processes by focusing in depth on the everyday relationships among citizens and their societal consequences. It thus aims to connect micro-level relationships to individual and macro-level outcomes.


## Git and GitHub

Learn `git` and GitHub using the following materials:

- [Happy Git and GitHub with R](https://happygitwithr.com) -- A nice online book and reference tuned towards R users, but very helpful even if you don't use R. The [Resources section](https://happygitwithr.com/resources.html) of that book contains useful links too.
